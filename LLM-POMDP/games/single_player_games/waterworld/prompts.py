Create a player character visually represented as a blue circle that can move freely within the game window using arrow keys.
Introduce a dynamic environment with equal number of green and red circles. Make the green and red circles move randomly around the screen.
Implement a scoring system, where the player earns points for each green circle captured and deduct one for each red circle . 
Display the current score in the top-left corner of the screen during gameplay.
When the player captures a circle, make it respawn in a random location on the screen as either red or green.
Ensure the game continues until all green circles have been captured. Once all green circles are captured, display a "Game Over!" message and stop all motion in the game.
Provide an option for the player to restart the game after it ends, creating a loop for continuous gameplay.
