iterative_prompts = """Create an agent character, visually represented as a blue circle, positioned on the screen. The agent should be movable in any direction based on user input.
Implement a green dot that moves randomly around the screen, serving as the target for the agent to navigate towards.
Introduce a red puck, a larger entity that slowly follows the agent's movements on the screen.
Allow the player to control the agent's movement using arrow keys or another specified input method.
Implement a scoring system that positively rewards the agent proportionally to the closeness between the agent and the green dot, and penalizes the agent for proximity to the red puck.
Display the current score in the top-left corner of the screen during gameplay.
Ensure the game has no predefined end, allowing for endless gameplay. 
Upon reaching the green dot, relocate it to a new random position, maintaining the challenge for the player.
