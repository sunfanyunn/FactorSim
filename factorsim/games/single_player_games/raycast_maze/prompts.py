Write code for a first-person 3d maze navigation game. Allow the character to turn using the 'a' and 'd' keys and walk forward or backward with the 'w' and 's' keys.
Render the game from the first person perspective of the character. Implement 3d rendering using raycasting and projection. Assume movement is restricted to the X-Y plane. Implement all necessary logic for rendering and raycasting. Do not omit anything for brevity.
Put a goal location in the maze. Reset the game when the character reaches the goal.
